# Time Series Forex Analysis

This project explores historical foreign exchange (forex) price data to understand trends,
volatility, and basic predictive behavior using Python.

The goal of this work is not to build a production trading system, but to demonstrate:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Basic time series modeling
- Visualization of real-world financial data

This project reflects my transition from software engineering and enterprise systems
into applied data science and analytical modeling.
